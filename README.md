## This fork

I'm currently in the process of trying to rebuild the original, cleaning up the tree, removing and re-generating as much of the generated files as possible.

Apparently, the required build tools are:

* Borland C++ 3.1
* Microsoft Visual C++ 1.52
* Turbo Pascal (7) -- not yet tested

I have the suspicion that I have messed up the line endings -- DOS line endings FTW!
